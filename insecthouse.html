                  <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
                    <p>Our garden is home to birds, bees and insects – all critters are welcome and part of the ecosystem. Our new insect hotel houses bugs that eat bugs,
                        such as spiders that hunt moths, flies, mosquitoes and ants. Also insects that pollinate flowers – such as the solitary carpenter bee – are welcome to snuggle in.
                        Our insect house offers all sorts of suites to choose from, each with a different bed filling with bark, straw or bamboo. Tiptoe closer and come peep carefully.
                        You never know who’s moved in – moth, centipede, wasp or lizard? Or Sharks supporter?</p>
                                <p><strong>WHERE TO FIND IT:</strong></p>
                                <p>You will find the Insect House, adjacent to the coffee shop.</p>
