                  <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                  <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to certain groups or species of simian mammals of infraorder Simiiformes. The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates, such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys.
                      Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal).
                      Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini.</p>
                       <p>Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 millimetres (4.6 in) with a 172-millimetre (6.8 in) tail and just over 100 grams (3.5 oz) in weight, to the male mandrill,
                            almost 1 metre (3.3 ft) long and weighing up to 36 kilograms (79 lb).</p>

                            <p>Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals (including insects and spiders).</p>
                                <p><strong>WHERE TO FIND THEM:</strong></p>
