                  <h3>TIGER</h3>
                  <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.</p>
                       <p>It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar.
                           It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring.
                           Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own</p>

                            <p>The tiger historically ranged from eastern Turkey and Transcaucasia to the coast of the Sea of Japan, and from South Asia across Southeast Asia to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali.</p>
                                <p><strong>WHERE TO FIND THEM:</strong></p>
                                <p>You will find the Tigers at pen F4, across the foodcourt.</p>
