                  <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                  <p>A warthog is identifiable by the two pairs of tusks protruding from the mouth and curving upwards.
                      The lower pair, which is far shorter than the upper pair, becomes razor-sharp by rubbing against the upper pair every time the mouth is opened and closed.</p>
                       <p>The common warthog is a medium-sized species, with a head-and-body length ranging from 0.9 to 1.5 metres (2 feet 11 inches to 4 feet 11 inches),
                           and shoulder height from 63.5 to 85 cm (2 ft 1 in to 2 ft 9+1‚ÅÑ2 in). Females, at 45 to 75 kilograms (99 to 165 pounds), are typically slightly smaller and lighter in weight than males, at 60 to 150 kg (130 to 330 lb).</p>

                            <p>The common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild member of the pig family (Suidae) found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa.
                                In the past, it was commonly treated as a subspecies of P. aethiopicus, but today that scientific name is restricted to the desert warthog of northern Kenya, Somalia, and eastern Ethiopia</p>
                                <p><strong>WHERE TO FIND THEM:</strong></p>
                                <p>You will find the Warthogs at pen E24, right next to the amphitheater.</p>
